                <h3>LION</h3>
                <P>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The
                commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in Africa. With some males exceeding
                250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.
                </P>

                <p>Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir
                Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in
                historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal
                after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from
                the Yukon to Peru.
                </P>
                <p>The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30 to 50% per two
                decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and
                national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are
                currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.
                </p>

                <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</P>


                <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier
